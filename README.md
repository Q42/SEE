SEE

SEE lets you view the web as a user with a visual impairment might

What is it like to be visually impaired? As a well-sighted person you'll likely never fully get to understand that. But SEE helps you imagine what it’s like.

For example, you could see what your website looks like for a colour blind person. Which might convince you to change the contrast in your design.

SEE is a product by Q42, developed by Johan Huijkman and Marcel Duin during w00tcamp 2012 (http://www.w00tcamp.nl). If you have any questions or just want to share your thoughts you can reach us at:
